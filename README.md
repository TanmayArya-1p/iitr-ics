Publish an ICS Calendar for my college classes so that I can subscribe to it using Thunderbird and Proton Calendar.

If you wish to add your classes, then add your API dump to [/calendars/yourname.json](/calendars) and submit a PR.

You can then use a URL like [https://onetincan.foo/iitr-ics/yourname.ics](https://onetincan.foo/iitr-ics/yourname.ics) to subscribe to.
